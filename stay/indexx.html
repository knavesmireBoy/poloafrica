				<p>The polo opportunities available for visitors at Uitgedacht Farm vary depending on Poloafrica tournament commitments and the Free State school holidays. During the school holidays focus at the farm is on the children and polo resources are devoted to the Trust's sport development requirements. The main buildings on the farm (the farmhouse and the newly formed schoolyard complex down by the polo field) are also rather busy in the daytime during the holidays due to the lifeskills classes being taught to the children.</p><p>If guests wish to visit during the holidays and to enjoy the fun of the Trust's holiday activities, certainly polo is possible, joining in with the children. We find that social interaction with visitors is valuable for the children to build their self-confidence as well as their English self-expression skills. More intensive polo programmes are available for visitors during the school terms. Please <a href="../enquiries#contact">contact us</a> to discuss what opportunities are available for your desired travel dates.

				<p>The sandstone farmhouse was built in the early years of last century and has been lovingly restored to provide contemporary accommodation whilst maintaining its original charm.</p><p> Additional rooms are available in surrounding rustic cottages, built either of sandstone or of traditional materials.</p><p> Every bedroom is unique but they all offer charming and luxurious accommodation with fine linens and comfortable furniture. Wherever you choose to stay, it is a treat to wake up to the tranquillity of the farm far from the sounds of modern life.

				<p>The charmingly appointed rooms of the farmhouse and cottages, with treasures collected from around the world, make Uitgedacht a perfect place to relax whilst enjoying one of the fires, browsing the books or chatting to friends.</p><p> We have a viewing room, where Poloafrica scholars and guests can watch films if they wish or, more importantly, polo coaching DVDs as well as their own performance in chukkas and on the wooden horse.</p><p> We do not, however, provide television access on the farm. Instead we want our guests simply to relax into the beauty of the countryside, to read, to look at the view. A sundowner on the stoep is always a joy.

				<p>Visitors tell us that dining is one of the highlights of their stay on the farm. Most of our food comes from an extensive vegetable garden where pigs, chickens, ducks and geese are also raised. With a selection of excellent wines from our cellar, eating at Uitgedacht is an experience to savour. </p><p>Dining areas including the conservatory, barbeque area and stoep at the farmhouse, and various interesting options at our cottages, offer guests the opportunity to take in the morning view or enjoy the sunset. </p><p>We also arrange picnics to be enjoyed in one of the many beautiful spots around the farm, or, of course, when watching the polo. Two favoured spots by the A field are either in our thatched clubhouse on the western side of the field, or behind the southern goals, high up on the sloping dam wall, under the willow tree.
